{-| -}
type World
    = World World.World


{-| Let be the new world!
-}
world : World
world =
    World World.world


{-| Call it to set the world’s gravity,
cause by default it’s an open space:

    setGravity (vec3 0 0 -10) world
    --> worldWithGravity

-}
setGravity : Vec3 -> World -> World
setGravity gravity (World world_) =
    World (World.setGravity gravity world_)


{-| You can also add bodies to the world. The function
returns updated world and an id of the body.

    addBody body world
    --> (newWorld, bodyId)

-}
addBody : Body -> World -> ( World, BodyId )
addBody (Body body_) (World world_) =
    ( World (World.addBody body_ world_)
    , World.getNextBodyId world_
    )


{-| A unique identifier of a body in the world.
It can be used to link additional information, like meshes.
-}
type alias BodyId =
    Body.BodyId


{-| Body is a solid matter without any moving parts.
-}
type Body
    = Body Body.Body


{-| This gives you an empty body, add shapes to turn it
into something meaningful.
-}
body : Body
body =
    Body Body.body


{-| After creating a body, you have to give it a mass.
Bodies without mass don’t move!

    setMass 5 boxBody
    --> heavyBoxBody

-}
setMass : Float -> Body -> Body
setMass mass (Body body_) =
    Body (Body.setMass mass body_)


{-| Adds a [shape](#Shape) at the center of the body
and returns a tuple of updated body and a shape id.
For example, call this to add a box:

    addShape (box (vec3 1 1 1)) body
    --> (newBody, shapeId)

-}
addShape : Shape -> Body -> ( Body, ShapeId )
addShape (Shape shape) (Body body_) =
    ( Body (Body.addShape shape body_)
    , Body.getNextShapeId body_
    )


{-| Same as BodyId, but for shapes within a body.
-}
type alias ShapeId =
    Shape.ShapeId


{-| Rotate the body around the axis by a specific angle
from its current orientation.

    rotateBy (vec3 1 0 0) pi body
    --> upsideDownBody

-}
rotateBy : Vec3 -> Float -> Body -> Body
rotateBy axis angle (Body body_) =
    Body
        { body_
            | quaternion =
                Quaternion.mul
                    (Quaternion.fromAngleAxis angle axis)
                    body_.quaternion
        }


{-| Move the body from its current position.

    offsetBy (vec3 0 0 12) body
    --> elevatedBody

-}
offsetBy : Vec3 -> Body -> Body
offsetBy offset (Body body_) =
    Body { body_ | position = Vec3.add offset body_.position }


{-| Shape is an integral part of a body. It is positioned in the
body’s coordinate system.

We support the following shapes:

  - [box](#box),
  - [sphere](#sphere),
  - [plane](#plane).

-}
type Shape
    = Shape Shape.Shape


{-| A box shape is defined by its half extends.
To create a 2x2 box, call this:

    box (vec3 1 1 1)

-}
box : Vec3 -> Shape
box halfExtends =
    Shape (Shape.Convex (ConvexPolyhedron.fromBox halfExtends))


{-| A sphere shape is defined by its radius.
-}
sphere : Float -> Shape
sphere radius =
    Shape (Shape.Sphere radius)


{-| A plane shape, with a normal pointing in the direction of the z axis.
-}
plane : Shape
plane =
    Shape Shape.Plane


{-| Simulate the world, given the time delta since the last step.

Call this function on a message from the [onAnimationFrame](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Events#onAnimationFrame) subscription!

-}
step : Float -> World -> World
step dt (World world_) =
    world_
        |> World.addGravityForces
        |> Solver.solve dt (NarrowPhase.getContacts world_)
        |> World.tick dt
        |> World


{-| Fold over each shape in the world. Use this to convert shapes into visual representation, e.g. WebGL entities.

    entities =
        fold
        ({ transform, bodyId, shapeId } currentEntities ->
            makeEntity transform bodyId shapeId :: currentEntities
        )
        []
        world

  - `transform` is a transformation matrix that offsets and rotates a shape into the world coorditantes

  - `bodyId` is an id of the body the shape belongs to

  - `shapeId` is an id of the shape within the body

Use `bodyId` and `shapeId` to link additional information from the outside of the engine, e.g. which mesh to render
or what color should this shape be.
